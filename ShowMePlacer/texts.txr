Use mouse clicks to create connections between blocks. Available spots for connections are visual dots on the middle of blocks. Use the + and â€“ buttons to add external IO that can be used to connect blocks as well. This IO blocks are static. Since this program use simulated annealing to do the placement, you can also edit the algorithm variables like temperatures and decay. For this, you have to click to edit and click to finish editing. Press the demo button to use a 36 blocks, 18 IOs and a netlist pre-created for demo purposes. Press Start for begin placing. To come back to this screen, use the back button.
